## Common Core 42 cursus projects
1.  **LIBFT**
    *   <sub> Implementation of the standard C library, libc. This library is expected to be
    my own library throught the course so changes and "bug fixes" are expected to occur.
    This recreated library includes functions that are not in its original, or being in it, are in a different form.
    Some functions are original from the bsd/libc. Has it is expected, this is my own libc :supervillain_man: </sub>
2.  **FT_PRINTF**
    *   <sub>Development of  a library that contains ft_printf(), a
        function that will mimic the original printf() from the libc.</sub>
2.  **GET_NEXT_LINE**
    *   <sub>Development of  a function that returns a line
        read from a file descriptor. Usage of static variables.
